Overview of ICS M.S. Programs




ICS offers M.S. degrees in Computer Science, Information and Computer Science, Software Engineering, Networked Systems, and Statistics. The objective of the terminal M.S. degree is to prepare students for a variety of advanced careers in the computing industry (e.g., software development, information technology consulting, application specific integrated circuit design, network design and configuration, embedded systems design, algorithms development, data mining). The Master's program can be pursued full- or part-time, and required courses may be taken during the first and second year of study. The degree should take no longer than two years if pursued full-time.

» M.S. Exams and Reviews
Graduate Student Review
At the end of each spring quarter, a formal review is conducted of all M.S. students. If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a letter of probation will be sent to the student and placed in their file. The probation period varies, depending on each student's academic situation. If the problem is not cleared during the probation period, the ICS Graduate Office may recommend dismissal from the program. It is the student's responsibility to make sure the ICS Graduate Office is aware of any problem that has been cleared during the probation period.
Advancing to Candidacy for the M.S. Degree
Advancement to candidacy implies that a student is almost finished with his/her degree requirements. This is not an automatic process. The students is responsible for making sure his or her form is completed and gets filed. The Advancement to Candidacy should be submitted at least one quarter before the student plans on graduating.
Comprehensive Exam (Option 1)
Students who elect for the Comprehensive Exam option must pass a comprehensive examination offered by the department or by a representative of the specific research area. Students should speak to the ICS Graduate Counselor or research area representative regarding test dates, preparation, and reading lists. The faculty within the particular area develops the exam; this may result in the content and structure varying from year to year.
Thesis Option (Option 2)
The thesis option is available to all Bren School M.S. students, except for those in the Statistics Program, who do not plan to take the comprehensive exam and who are in good academic standing with the School. Students pursuing this option must enroll in at least two quarters of Thesis Supervision, which will substitute for two required courses as specified under the concentration area or track of choice. A committee will guide the student and give final approval of the thesis. An oral presentation of the thesis to the committee is required.
 
» Degree Conferral
The M.S. degree will be conferred by the UCI Graduate Division the quarter following advancement to candidacy if all degree requirements are satisfied. Graduate Division will send a letter of degree confirmation. Diplomas will be ready for pick up from the Registrar's Office about four months after graduation.
